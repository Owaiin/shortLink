# Shortlink - [Live Link](https://shortlink-wedlake.netlify.app/)

I wanted to challenge myself to using just HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS to use some of the concepts I'm comfortable with in React and Next. I actually really enjoyed this as it was a challenge using traditional CSS and not TailwindCSS anymore.
Plus, not having the ability to use Reacts state management took a minute to get used to.


## Further Changes
I need to handle error state in the api call, as at the moment anything that's not a URL is just logged to the console.
