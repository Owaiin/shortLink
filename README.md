# Shortlink

I wanted to challenge myself to using just HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS to use some of the concepts I'm comfortable with in React and Next. I actually really enjoyed this as it was a challenge using traditional CSS and not TailwindCSS anymore.
Plus, not having the ability to use Reacts state management took a minute to get used to.
